## Hi 👋🏻  I'm Joa!

I'm a Data Engineering and Analytics Master student **@TUM**. I’m so proud of my Final Degree Thesis on NLP, where I tried to find the best text similarity technique from the NLP zoo. For large texts, the small ones are overcome. You can know more in the pinned below repo.

- ⚙️ I use daily: `.py`, `.js` & `.cpp`
- 💻 Ecosystem: I am an Apple fanboy and I can't help it. Linux is an alternative. If you use Windows, I just should suggest you a change
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as possible about AI and Data
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: My friends say I'm half productivity and half sleep 💻😴
